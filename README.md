# Installation

Install node.js

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

or download from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Create Empty Database

```bash
npm run db
```

Start the web server

```bash
npm run prod
```

## Key Generation

Only use the default keys for development.

If you are moving to production:

Use `ssh-keygen` to generate a private key:
`ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -m PEM -f jwtRS256.key`
(Do not enter a passphrase!)

And a public key:
`openssl rsa -in jwtRS256.key -pubout -outform PEM -out jwtRS256.key.pub`

Update the `.env` to use the new file names.
In this example the private key was jwt.RS256.key and the public key was jwt.RS256.key.pub

# Cryptography

## Registration and Login

`bcrypt` is used for user password hashing and salting.

No plaintext passwords are stored.

When the user attempts to login, their password is hashed and compared against the stored hash.

## Authentication

`JSON Web Tokens` are used as authentication tokens.

JWTs contain a digital signature that guarantees integrity.

## Message Sending

## Key Passing

# Documentation

## HTTP Endpoints

### POST `/register`

**request**

```
{
  username: string
  password: string
}
```

**response**

```
{
  authToken: string
}
```

### POST `/login`

**request**

```
{
  username: string
  password: string
}
```

**response**

```
{
  authToken: string
}
```

## Web Socket Endpoints

### `connection`

```
{
  auth: {
    token: string,
  }
}
```

---

### `disconnect`

---

### `message`

```
{
  conversation: string,
  isImage: bool,
  msg: string,
  checksum: string
}
```

# TODO

## Front-end

Better design
  -  /chat and /chat/{room} could be fleshed out more

Store symmetrical key for chats in local storage
Encrypt messages before sending

- Pressing ENTER in the chat message box should send the message
- When a message is sent, the chat message box should be cleared
- When entering a room, ask the user to confirm
- When a user is logs in, ask the user which digital signature scheme will be used: RSA or DSA

## Back-end

- Permanently store messages in DB

- Endpoint for fetching previous chat messages (maybe just add to room get)

- Add DELETE endpoint for deleting a chatroom

- Add public key to client module (RSA-done) or DSA based on user preference)

- consider using JWT that can use either RSA or DSA for digital signatures.
  - Does JWT meet the requirement of E(PUa, E(PRs, SymmetricKey)) that supplies the symmetric
    key with confidentiality and digital signature of the Server? Only digital signature
      - jsonwebtoken - https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken

- How does the user know the Public Key of the Server?
  - currently, the server sends the public key after register/login
  - Should we have a handshake instead?

- Add a DSA keypair to the Server?
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-rsa - npm install node-rsa

    or
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsrsasign
    npm install jsrsasign jsrsasign-util
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jsrsasign/8.0.20/jsrsasign-all-min.js"></script>

Completed Items:
- Add an RSA keypair - use the one that exists already
  - https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-rsa - npm install node-rsa
  - browserify node-rsa for the clients

- create a new endpoint for a user to get the symmetric key for a chatroom (/key)

- Symmetric Key Encryption
    - 256-bit keys
    - CBC Mode
    - send IV with the Key
    - use Crypto-JS 4.1.1 library for AES - https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js

- Add public key to client module (RSA) or DSA based on user preference

- On ChatRoom Creation:
  - Generate symmetrical key
  - Store in DB
